# SnapStart Example for Java 11

"SnapStart" is a feature of AWS Lambda that aims to significantly reduce "cold start" time. This repository is the example
code described in my blog article at https://blog.symphonia.io/posts/2023-01-24_snapstart-how that explains how to use SnapStart.
For details on how to build, deploy, and execute this example code please refer to the blog post.

**Important**: this code was written in January 2023, shortly after SnapStart was released. If you are looking at this code
a long time after this date it is likely that certain aspects will have changed, so if in doubt refer to the Lambda documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html).

The example here came from my book with John Chapin - [_Programming AWS Lambda_](https://blog.test.symphonia.io/posts/2020-04-01_programming_aws_lambda_book) . You can find all of the example source code for the book [here](https://github.com/symphoniacloud/programming-aws-lambda-book).
